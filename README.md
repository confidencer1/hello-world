## Overview
This project employed two types of machine learning methods to classify the fashion MNIST dataset:

- Support Vector Machine
- Convolutional Neural Network
  - Resnet
  - VGGnet

Two dimensionality reduction techniques are applied on SVM: 
 
- PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
- LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis)

## Dataset

[Fashion-MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.

## Tunable Parameters

### PCA Parameters
- **pca_target_dim:** Using PCA to reduce the data dimension to this number.

### LDA Parameters
- **components_number:** Number of components (< n_classes - 1) for dimensionality reduction.

### SVM Parameters
- **kernel:** Kernel of Support Vector Machine.

### SVM with Different Kernels

- SVM Poly vs RBF

Dataset | SVM Poly | SVM RBF
-------- | -------------- | ------------ 
LDA Training set | 84.47% | 85.19%
PCA Training set | 87.87% | 88.35%
LDA Testing set | 82.49 % | 83.41 %
PCA Testing set | 86.03 % | **86.59 %**

- SVM Time Cost

Dataset | SVM Poly | SVM RBF
-------- | -------------- | ------------ 
Training set | 148.41s | 172.30s
Testing set | **73.51s** | 81.74s

From accuracy perspective, SVM with RBF kernel is better but it takes longer training time than Ploy kernel.
And SVM with Linear kernel spent too long to take into account. Thus, only RBF and Poly kernel are tested here.

### CNN
The gaussian based Bayes classifier is a simple self built class, thus the accuracy maybe lower than the built-in 
classifier from scikit-learn or other libraries.

PCA dimension is set to 30 and LDA set to default in both methods.

Dataset | Bayes Accuracy | KNN Accuracy
-------- | -------------- | ------------ 
LDA Training set | 75.12 % | 87.00 %
PCA Training set | 71.91 % | 88.59 %
LDA Testing set | 73.70 % | 83.06 %
PCA Testing set | 71.58 % | 85.46 %
